## Rust

A repository for all of my Rust projects. As stated on my [home page](https://github.com/isaacbutz280/Personal-Projects), Rust is my favorite language. The compiler
checking for memory errors without losing speed is a thing of beauty.
For all of these projects, you can clone this repo to your local machine and use `cargo run` to build and run the program. See below for a quick synopsis of each project:

- `guess_game` - Based on the guessing game built in [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html), with a few small modifications I made. Has the user guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100.
- `llength` - A command line tool to count the line length in a file.
- `slides` - A command line tool for batch renaming files.
- `webserver` - Again following the tutorial in [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html) I developed a small, multi-threaded web server.
