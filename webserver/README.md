## webserver

While following the instructions laid out in [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html), I developed a simple multi-threaded
web server. To run it on your own machine, use `cargo run`, and then point your browser to `127.0.0.1:7878`. This should pull up a Sonic HTML game that I found online.
